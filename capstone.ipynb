    "There are 29,560 restaurants in Los Angeles according to a count in 2018. That is a lot of potential restaurants to choose from ranging in cuisines, loation and quality. Finding a restaurant that you will like is a hard, time-consuming and often laborious task. Websites such as Yelp can be helpful showing you some of the best rated restaurants in your area. However, just because other people have enjoyed that restaurant does not necessarily mean you will enjoy it. That is why there is a need for a more personalized system of recommending a restaurant to the individual user. \n",

The recommender will take into account the cuisine, quality and location of the restaurants and personalize the recommendations to the user."
