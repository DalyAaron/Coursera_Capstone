    "There are 29,560 restaurants in Los Angeles according to a count in 2018. That is a lot of potential restaurants to choose from ranging in cuisines, location and quality. Finding a restaurant that you will like is a hard, time-consuming and often laborious task. Websites such as Yelp can be helpful showing you some of the best rated restaurants in your area. However, just because other people have enjoyed a restaurant does not necessarily mean you will enjoy it too. That is why there is a need for a more personalized system of recommending a restaurant to the individual user. The reccomendation system is tailored to an individual user and thus the end-user is an individual who is looking for restaurant recommendations. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook I will do just that, creating a recommendation system based off of a user's previous reviews and ratings they have left at some of their favorite restaurants in Los Angeles. The recommender will take into account the cuisine, quality and location of the restaurants and personalize the recommendations to the user."

This dataset is a fictional example of an individual user, which in a real world production scenario would be replaced with the Foursquare users API which allows a user id to be passed in order to get the user's data. Unfortunately, I do not have a list of Foursquare user id's, so this fictional dataset will suffice for this project.\n"
